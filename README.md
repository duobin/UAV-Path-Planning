# Deep Reinfocement Learning vs A* on UAV Path Planning #
### This is a Deep Reinforcement Learning approach to the problem described in the PDF File ###

## Phase 0: ## 
  Generate 115 paths using A* (previous approach)
## Phase 1: ##
  Generate 115 images and videos from the A* paths
## Phase 2: ##
  Create a DQN and train/test on the same destinations as A* and compare them
## Phase 3: ##
  Try the DQN on non-static path planning cases (with moving vehicles) and compare to previous approach
