# UAV-Path-Planning
A Deep Learning Approach to UAV Path Planning

In this phase, we generate paths using the DQN approach for comparison with the MATLAB path planning
Results can be seen in results folder.
To run simply run "run.py" A parameter indicating which test case is passed in "run.py"
Folders 0-14 contain different test cases with different parameter experimentation.
